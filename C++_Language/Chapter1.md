# C++

### `Facts`:

- **Bjarne Stroustrup** in `1979` at At&T's Bell Laboratory
- Due to the main use of classes, he initially named it **C with Classes**. But, it was renamed as C++ in 1983
- C++ OOP was inspired by a computer simulation language called `Simula67`
- **Java** was also written in C++
- Major OS of modern times written in C++
- C++ is worlds 4th most used programming language

### `Features`:

- C++ is a middle-level language that supports the principle of object-oriented paradigm
- C++ joins three separate programming traditions:
  - Procedural Language tradition, represented by C
  - Object-Oriented Language tradition, represented by class enhancements C++ adds to C
  - Generic Programming, supported by C++ templates

### `Comparision b/w C and C++`:

- C++ is a subset of the C language
- C++ program can use existing C software libraries
- C follows **_top-down_** approach and adopts **_POP_** (Procedure Oriented programming)
- C++ follows **_bottom-top_** approach and adopts **_OOP_** (Object Oriented Programming)

### `OOP`:

- OOP is a programming approach which revolves around the concept **_object_**
- `Object`:
  - Any entity in the system that can be defined as a set of properties and set of properties and set of operations performed using entity property set
  - It allows the decomposition of a problem into several entities called **object** and then builds data and functions around them

### `Properties`:

1. **Encapsulation**: Wrapping up data and fun into a single unit
2. **Data Hiding**: The principle of restricting access to the internal state and implementation details of a class, typically achieved by using access specifiers like *private* and *protected*
3. **Abstraction**: Hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary and relevant features
4. **Polymorphism**: Allows a function, method, or object to take on many forms, enabling a single interface to represent different underlying data types or classes, typically achieved through inheritance and function overriding
5. **Inheritance**: Concept where a new class (derived class) is created from an existing class (base class), allowing the derived class to inherit and optionally override or extend the properties and behaviors (methods) of the base class
6. **Data Abstraction**: Process of reducing a body of data to a specific representation of a whole. Classes use the concept of data abstraction, known as _Abstract Data Types_
